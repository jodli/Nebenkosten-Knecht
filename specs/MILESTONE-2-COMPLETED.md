# Nebenkosten-Knecht - Increment 2 Completion Report

## Summary

Increment 2 of the Nebenkosten-Knecht project has been successfully completed. This phase builds upon the foundation established in Increment 1 by adding meter reading tracking, history viewing, and consumption calculation capabilities.

## Completed Features

### M4: Manual Meter Reading Entry
- Created database schema and Rust models for meter readings with validation
- Implemented CRUD API endpoints with chronological validation
- Developed Vue.js components for entering and updating meter readings
- Added safeguards to prevent illogical readings (values lower than previous readings)

### M5: View Meter Reading History
- Implemented API endpoints for retrieving meter reading history
- Created Vue.js components for displaying reading history by meter
- Added sorting and filtering capabilities for reading history
- Included navigation between meters and their readings

### M6: Basic Consumption Calculation
- Implemented consumption calculation logic in the backend
- Created API endpoints for retrieving consumption data
- Developed Vue.js components for displaying consumption data
- Added daily average consumption calculations

## Technical Implementation Details

### Backend (Rust/Actix-Web/Diesel)
- Created new migration for the meter_readings table with appropriate indexes
- Implemented complex validation for meter readings to ensure chronological and logical consistency
- Designed API endpoints for retrieving readings by meter, date range, and for consumption calculation
- Added proper error handling for invalid reading scenarios

### Frontend (Vue.js/Tailwind CSS)
- Extended API service to interface with meter reading endpoints
- Created responsive components for managing readings with mobile support
- Implemented meter reading forms with validation
- Added consumption view with detailed metrics
- Updated Dashboard and navigation to include meter readings

## Project Structure
- Added meter reading handlers and models to the backend structure
- Created new frontend views for meter readings and consumption
- Maintained consistent architecture and code organization throughout new components

## Next Steps (Increment 3)
The next phase will focus on:
- Cost Management (setting up cost categories, rates, and specific costs)
- Cost Assignment to Property Units
- Basic Utility Cost Statement Generation

## Conclusion
Increment 2 enhances the Nebenkosten-Knecht application with crucial meter data tracking capabilities. Users can now not only set up their property structure but also track utility usage over time, view historical readings, and calculate consumption - essential steps toward generating accurate utility cost statements.
