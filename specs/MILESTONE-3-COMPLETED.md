Increment 3 of the Nebenkosten-Knecht project has been successfully completed. This phase extends the application with cost management, cost assignment to property units, and the first version of utility cost statement generation.

## Completed Features

### M7: Cost Management
- Implemented database schema and Rust models for cost types, tariffs (consumption-based), and fixed costs
- Developed CRUD API endpoints for cost types, tariffs, and fixed costs
- Added allocation method management and assignment to cost types

- Developed Vue.js components to display statements and breakdowns for users

## Technical Implementation Details

### Backend (Rust/Actix-Web/Diesel)
- Added migrations for cost management tables and cost assignment relations
- Implemented robust validation for cost and assignment logic
- Designed endpoints for CRUD operations and statement generation
- Improved error handling and response consistency

### Frontend (Vue.js/Tailwind CSS)
- Extended API service for new cost and statement endpoints
- Built responsive views for cost management, assignment, and statement display
- Enhanced forms with validation and user feedback
- Updated navigation and dashboard to include new cost and statement features

## Project Structure
- Added cost handlers, models, and assignment logic to backend
- Created new frontend views for cost management and statements
- Maintained modular and consistent code organization

## Next Steps (Increment 4)
The next phase will focus on:
- Advanced statement features (customization, export)
- User roles and permissions
- Further UI/UX improvements and reporting

## Conclusion
Increment 3 brings comprehensive cost management and the first version of utility cost statements to Nebenkosten-Knecht. Users can now define cost types, assign costs to property units, and generate statementsâ€”laying the groundwork for advanced reporting and billing in future increments.
